This repository contains two Machine Learning projects. Both of them use the same dataset. 
1. One project named "Classification" tackles the task of Supervised Learning. In this project, I used the dataset to build a model which utilized data from all the counties in the US except for the ones in the state of Texas. This was a binary classification task where the target variable defined if the counties fall under high risk or low risk categories. If the counties had higher than average covid cases or covid related deaths then I considered them as high risk. Then I used the model to make predictions about the counties in Texas.
2. The other project, "Clustering", we did unsupervised learning. The aim of this project was to identify patterns in unlabeled data and then form clusters of counties. And then look at the what patterns were identified from the Clusters. I used two different kinds of features for cluster analysis. One type had features related to the various economic indicators in the census data, such as Median Income, Income per capita, poverty, People depending upon assistance/food stamps and median rent. And another category of features that I used belonged to number of people working in different industries such as mining/fishing/hunting, construction, manufacturing, Information technology, public administration.
