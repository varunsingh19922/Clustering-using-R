This repository contains two Machine Learning projects. Both of them use the same dataset. 
1. One project named Classification tackles the task of Supervised Learning. In this project, I used the dataset to build a model which utilized data from all the counties in the US except for the ones in the state of Texas. And then I used the model to make predictions about severity of covid cases and covid related deaths in the state of Texas.
